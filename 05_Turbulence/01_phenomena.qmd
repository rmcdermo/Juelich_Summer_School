# Phenomena

## Example -- From a laminar to a turbulent flow

Example of a candle plume, which transits from a laminar to a turbulent flow.

## Macroscopic impact

In general: 

- Intermittency
- Scalar Mixing
- Eddies
- Cascade
- Dissipation at small scales
- Chaotic, yet structured

In fire dynamics:

- mixing for combustion
- fire plume dynamics
- enhance of heat and mass transfer

## Example?

pipe flow

magnitude velocity profile

non trivial normal velocities

instantanious velocity values (maybe from our plume measurements?)

## Exercise -- Compute fluctuation spectrum?

given instantanious velocity data, compute fluctuations
