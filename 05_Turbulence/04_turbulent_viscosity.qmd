## Exercise -- Decay of Isotropic Turbulence

**Description:** An initial velocity field (file [cbc32_uvw.csv](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/cbc32_uvw.csv)) in a periodic cubid domain (length $L$) is used to compute the decay of the kinetic energy due to turbulence. The number of grid points $n$ in all directions is 32.

L = 0.56549\ m
$$

$$
k_0 = \frac{2\pi}{L} = 11.11\ m^{-1}
$$

$$
k_{\text{Nq}} = \frac{k_0 \cdot n}{2} = 177.77\ m^{-1}

## Exercise -- Task (I)

1. Use the FDS input file template ([dec_turb_template.fds](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/dec_turb_template.fds)).
1. Run the provided input file and visualise the velocity field (slices at domain boundary).
1. Add a device to monitor the mean kinetic energy in the whole volume. 
```
ID = 'KE'
QUANTITY = 'KINETIC ENERGY'
SPATIAL_STATISTIC = 'MEAN'
```
4. Plot the development of the mean kinetic energy as a function of time.
1. Create two additional cases:
- molecular viscosity only
- no turbulent and no molecular viscosity
6. Plot the development in all cases and add the following reference data:
```
ref_x = [0.0, 0.28, 0.67]
ref_y = [0.048, 0.0175, 0.0093]
```

## Exercise -- Task (II)

The provided input file outputs the full velocity field at three selected times. 

```
&DUMP RAMP_UVW='times' /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.00 /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.28 /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.67 /
```

Use the script [plot_spectrum.py](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/plot_spectrum.py) to compute and visualise the kinetic energy spectrum. Eventually, paths in the script need to be adjusted.
