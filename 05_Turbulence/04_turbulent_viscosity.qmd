# LES Turbulent Viscosity Models 

## General Idea

- Gradient diffusion idea: turbulence enhances fluxes, which are oriented by the concentration gradient and a diffusivity 

$$
\overline{\textbf{u}\, \phi} = -D_t \nabla\bar{\phi}
$$

- Multiple models available
- Selection is based on comparision with validation experiments

## Constant Coefficient Smagorinski Model

The turbulent viscosity in this model is estimated as

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{t}} = \rho \left(C_{\text{S}} \Delta \right)^2 |S|
$$

with 

$$
|S| = \sqrt{ 2 S_{ij} S_{ij} - \frac{2}{3} \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \right)^2 }
$$

and the Smagorinski constant $C_\text{S} = 0.2$.

This model was default in old versions of FDS.

## Deardorff Model

This is the current default model in FDS. It computes the turbulent viscosity as 

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{t}} = \rho\, C_{V} \Delta \sqrt{k_{\mathrm{sgs}}}
$$

using the following approximation for $k_{\mathrm{sgs}}$

$$
k_{\mathrm{sgs}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( (\bar{u} - \hat{\bar{u}})^2 + (\bar{v} - \hat{\bar{v}})^2 + (\bar{w} - \hat{\bar{w}})^2 \right)
$$

Where $\bar{u}$ is the cell average at the cell center -- filtered velocity at $\Delta$ length scale. 

<!-- $$
\bar{u}_{ijk} = \frac{u_{ijk} + u_{i-1,jk}}{2}
$$ -->

And a weighted averaged velocity $\hat{\bar{u}}$ at the test filter length scale $2\Delta$.

<!-- $$
\hat{\bar{u}}_{ijk} = \frac{\bar{u}_{ijk}}{2} + \frac{\bar{u}_{i-1,jk} + \bar{u}_{i+1,jk}}{4}
$$ -->

The Deardorff constant $C_V$ is set to 0.1, based on literature.

## Exercise -- Decay of Isotropic Turbulence

**Description:** An initial velocity field (file [cbc32_uvw.csv](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/cbc32_uvw.csv)) in a periodic cubic domain (length $L$) is used to compute the decay of the kinetic energy due to turbulence. The number of grid points in all directions is 32.

k_{\text{Nq}} &= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_\text{min}} = \frac{2\pi}{2\Delta}\\
&= \frac{k_0 \cdot n}{2} = 177.77\ m^{-1}

## Exercise -- Task (I)

1. Use the FDS input file template ([dec_turb_template.fds](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/dec_turb_template.fds)).
1. Run the provided input file and visualize the velocity field (slices at domain boundary).
1. Add a device to monitor the mean kinetic energy in the whole volume. 
```
ID = 'KE'
QUANTITY = 'KINETIC ENERGY'
SPATIAL_STATISTIC = 'MEAN'
```
4. Plot the development of the mean kinetic energy as a function of time.
1. Create two additional cases:
- molecular viscosity only
- no turbulent and no molecular viscosity
6. Plot the development in all cases and add the following reference data:
```
ref_x = [0.0, 0.28, 0.67]
ref_y = [0.048, 0.0175, 0.0093]
```

Hint: If needed, use the plotting script [plot_ke.py](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/plot_ke.py), which expects data in subdirectories of `rundir`.

## Exercise -- Task (II)

The provided input file outputs the full velocity field at three selected times. 

```
&DUMP RAMP_UVW='times' /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.00 /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.28 /
&RAMP ID='times', T=0.67 /
```

Use the script [plot_spectrum.py](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/plot_spectrum.py) to compute and visualize the kinetic energy spectrum, and to compare it with reference data [cbcdata.txt](./exercises/decaying_turbulence/cbcdata.txt). Eventually, paths in the script need to be adjusted, default is `rundir/deardorff`.
