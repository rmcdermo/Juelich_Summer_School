# Turbulent Combustion

## Also known as Turbulence-Chemistry-Interaction

- But no one every says, "TCI", for whatever reason
- In LES, composition (species and temperature) fields are under resolved
- This means gradients are under estimated and hence mixing rates are under estimated
- Another way to say this is, without a subgrid model the scalar dissipation rates would be under estimated
- This means that the rate at which the scalar variance decays would be too slow
- Reaction rates would be too slow and heat release rates would be inaccurate

## Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC)

- The workhorse turbulent combustion model for fire is, technically, the "Eddy Disspation Model" (EDM)
- First proposed by Bj\orn Magnussen in 1976
- This is the classic "mixed is burnt" model
- Another way to think of this is that EDM is EDC with infinitely fast chemistry
- The rate of combustion (heat release) is completely determined by availability of fuel and air and the rate of mixing
